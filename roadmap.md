# Ideas

- Add a mayor NPC (similar to the one in Overthrow Community Edition). At this NPC, you will be able to donate to the city, fund new buildings (artificial), etc. to increase the town's stability. 
- Add an ability for NATO soldiers to change sides to yours
- Add mission for assassinating political figures (this will decrease stability in the town greatly, although the political figure will have a pretty good escort with him)
- Change arsenal to Jeroen Arsenal
